              <p>As Jen Simmons has so often stated in her podcast<a href="http://thewebahead.net/" class="link--white"> The Web Ahead</a>, I believe that any web project begins with good content oranized and structured with HTML. This helps to put the emphasis on content. Without it, you risk losing the focus of why users are actually accessing your product.</p>
              <p>Before any design is applied, I always write solid HTML.</p>
